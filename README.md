# Project Description
In one or two sentences, present your project to us!

# Project Implementation

Dataset: Indicate the dataset you chose to use, any preprocessing steps that were applied, as well as the reasoning behind these choices.

Model Development and Training: Discuss your model implementation choices, the training procedure, the conditions you settled on (e.g., hyperparameters), and discuss why these are a good set for your task.

Model Evaluation/Results: Present the metrics you chose and your model evaluation results. 

# Project Reflection
Discussion: 
How well does your dataset, model architecture, training procedures, and chosen metrics fit the task at hand? 
Can your efforts be extended to wider implications, or contribute to social good? Are there any limitations in your methods that should be considered before doing so?
If you were to continue this project, what would be your next steps?
